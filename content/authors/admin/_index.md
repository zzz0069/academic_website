I'm Zheng, a Ph.D. student at Auburn University since 2021, working under Dr. [Sanjeev Baskiyar](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/~baskisa/)'s supervision. Prior to joining Dr. Baskiyar's lab, I had the privilege of collaborating with Dr. [Bo Liu](https://liubo-cs.github.io/) and Dr. [Levent Yilmaz](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/~yilmale/).
