abstract: "Given the abundance of cyber-attacks in wireless communications, machine learning can be essential in identifying intrusions. Ensemble learning has been proven to be a well-known technique for boosting performance and reducing variance. In this paper, we propose a simple ensemble supervised machine learning system, which consists of three classifiers: one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network, FT-Transformer, and XGBoost, to categorize network traffic as benign or malicious. To find a suitable ensemble method for these classifiers, we deployed three ensemble strategies, and the experimental outcomes proved that the proposed ensemble model substantially outperforms current intrusion detection architectures in terms of several classification metrics. Our model offers high Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score when evaluated on three benchmark datasets. The research showcases the viability of various algorithms, the power of the self-attention model, and the significance of ensemble approaches in strengthening cyber-defense strategies and understanding modern cyber threats."
