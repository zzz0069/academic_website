abstract: "This paper investigates the potential effects that user
gender information has on online sexism detection, in terms of
both binary and multi class detection. Social media has recently
developed into a center for sexist posts that target especially
women. Since most sexist comments are made especially against
people of a particular gender, whether the gender information
of the users could be effective or not for sexism detection, is still
an important question. Here we try to address this issue using
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models. Experiments showed that combining user gender information
with textual features improved classification performance both in
terms of binary classification and multi class classification. The
effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by the
experimental results reported in this research."
