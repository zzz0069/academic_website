## Summary
We first summarizes the recent advances in ILP and a discussion of statistical relational learning and neural-symbolic algorithms, which offer synergistic views to ILP. Following a critical review of the recent advances, we delineate observed challenges and highlight potential avenues of further ILP-motivated research toward developing self-explanatory artificial intelligence systems ([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10092808)). Second, we are Establishing a Neural-Symbolic Reinforcement Learning model built on state-of-the-art image captioning models, differentiable inductive logic programming, and policy gradient (In progress).
